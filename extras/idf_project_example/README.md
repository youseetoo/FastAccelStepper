This folder contains a bare bones functional ESP-IDF project.

You can create one using the **ESP-IDF: New Project** command in
Visual Studio code, or use this one as a basis. If you do use this one
as a basis for your own project, review the `.gitignore` file as it
excludes files you would not want to exclude in a normal project.
Normally only the `managed_components` and `build` folders would be
excluded from version control.
